<p>I have over 20 years of experience building bespoke web applications from the ground up. I attened City Lit web development courses in HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript in 2013. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working alongside experts in design and programming who have been incredible mentors.</p>

<p>I have a strong foundation in traditional web development, working independently with clients and designers on both front-end and back-end projects. My expertise spans modern development practices across a variety of environments, including WordPress and Drupal as headless CMS platforms, as well as Node.js with Strapi CMS, React, and Next.js.</p>

<p>Early in my career, I collaborated with a former lead designer at Pentagram Design Consultancy, honing iterative design processes for clients in private, public, and non-profit sectors. I also contributed to a codebase developed by JL Development, extending bespoke CMS solutions and cloud-based POS systems.</p>

<p>Currently, I am developing a campsite booking website using Next.js, Strapi, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I am exploring the use of Solid Pods for a social history archive. My interests include Deno, Svelte, HTMX, PWAs, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Web 3.0 technologies.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Iâ€™ve volunteered my tech skills for social justice campaigns, having a mapping featured on Channel 4 News. I am a father to two wonderful young children.</p>
