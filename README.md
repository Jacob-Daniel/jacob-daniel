<p>I am a mid-level full-stack developer with 15yrs experience building websites and web applications from the ground up. I love what I do and I am dedicated to delivering great work.</p>

<p>I am interested in and an early adopter of Progressive Web Apps, striving to create Single Page Application functionality for Multi Page Web Applications running in the browser.</p>

<p>I am currently upgrading a legacy Wordpress website to a Wordpress Headless CMS for a small book publisher. The new website will have a decoupled front-end built with Next.js and use WPGraphQL to do the data fetching from the server.</p>

<p>I am particular interested in *coding for good*.</p>
<p>I work with PHP, MYSQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, React, Nextjs, Graphql, Bash Scripting, Github, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
